# The prototype

## Test 1: Controlling Wheels 2018-06-26

### Target: Have a movable robot.

Wiring & Parts: Mostly the same as here: https://tutorials-raspberrypi.de/raspberry-pi-roboter-bausatz-zusammenbau/
Currently the rpbi is powered via an external usb cable, not by the batteries.

### Code:

See /javascript/ 

It seems, the tiny cables are adding to much restancy, so the pi cannot be powered this way...
