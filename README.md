# Chessbots

## What is this about?

You probably have seen something like this:
[![Street chess picture from wikipedia](./devblog/images/street-chess-wikipedia.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Katushakki_-_Street_chess,_Finland.jpg)

My idea is, to make the pieces movable. You play a game on your mobile phone or any other device that has a webbrowser, and the real pieces on the street will also make every move you and your opponent will make.

So, we are talking about 32 individual robots, each one is a selfmoving chesspiece, that play our game.

## Current state of the project

This is a very early project state.  I'm prototyping the general concepts of how to move, how to keep track of movements, how to power each robot long enough for at least one game, and so on.

You may contact me (have a look at my github profile, or leave an issue), if you are interested in this project or want to contribute. There are plenty of issues, that are not solved yet. (languages I understand: german and english)

## Languages

Currently: Arduino with C, rest mostly HTML+Javascript, OpenCV-Research with python

Goal: All with python.
